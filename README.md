# Do I Am Cake?
A Minecraft Modpack meant for The Official Twilight Forest Testing Server
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/do-i-am-cake/

## About
As this pack is meant for a testing server, and specifically meant to test the [Twilight Forest Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-twilight-forest), the goal is to keep it as light as possible. Minimal mods are to be included, most having some sort of compatibility with the Twilight Forest Mod with some exceptions.

All information about the server can be found over at the [Twilight Forest Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YfSMVtA) in the #server-info channel.

## Pack Updates
These generally happen when either A.) Twilight Forest recently got an update and is in need of testing or B.) There's a major or annoying bug/crash/issue in the pack as it currently is that needs attention.

Updates are usually slow, there wont be an update every time one of the mods in the pack are updated, rather mods get updated all in one batch when ready.

## Suggestions
Yes, these are allowed, you may use the issue tracker for such.
### Add this Mod!
Sure, but first lets ask the following:
 - Why?
 - Is there any compatability or mod integration with Twilight Forest in this mod?
   - This isn't strictly necessary but is a huge plus
 - Is this a massive mod? Remember we wish to keep this a light pack
### Remove this mod!
 - Provide good reason
   - Perhaps there no longer exists compatibility with Twilight Forest?
   - Or maybe this is a very unstable mod, causing crashes and unstability. It's become a nuisance.
### Change this config!
 - As usual, provide good reason
   - Does this improve gameplay with Twilight Forest?
   - Does it remain balanced?
   
Ultimately it's up to the pack developers to include the suggestion, they have the final say regardless.

## Where's X client side mod!?! (Minimaps as an example)
Well, long ago it was decided that players can modify their own instance of the pack to their fitting and that we shouldn't add too many client side mods that some will just remove in favor of well.. their favorite mods.
